## General Information

Structure Scanners are used to make 3D scans of real world objects. They work best in environments with soft light and are best at scanning human faces and objects in high contrast environments. Structure Scanners struggle to scan dark objects, hair, fur, feathers, and reflective items. Due to its short battery life, it is highly recommended that the Structure Scanner be fully charged before use.

## Calibrating

Prior to each scanning session, you will want to check the calibration to ensure that you can properly scan objects. If you are sure that the scanner is already calibrated, you can skip these steps. Otherwise, follow these steps:

1. Unplug the scanner from the iPad if it is plugged in.
2. Open the app called **Calibration**.
3. Ensure that you are calibrating in a well-lit environment.
4. Plug in the scanner. If it does not recognize the scanner, you may need to unplug the scanner and plug it back in.
5. Press **Start Calibration** and follow the instructions in the app.
6. Close the **Calibration** app when you are finished calibrating.

## Scanning

1. Open the app called **Scanner**.
2. Pointing the scanner at your object of choice, make sure that the whole object fits within the cube on the app. You may need to move closer or further away from your object to make it fit.
3. Press **Start Scan** when the object is in the cube.
4. Slowly walk around the object while pointing the scanner at it. Follow the directions on the app as they appear. If you move too fast or if the view of the object is disrupted in any way, you risk losing tracking of the scan.
    - In the event that you lose tracking (the scanner cannot tell where your object is), you can try to regain tracking by walking back to the beginning of the scan and pointing the scanner at your object. If this does not regain tracking, you may have to start over by pressing **Restart**.
    - Make sure to scan overhanging areas of your object (ex: the underneath of chins on people) and any wrinkles in clothing, hair, etc.
5. Press **Done** when you are finished scanning.
